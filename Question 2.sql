Combining the Three Address Schema Approaches
Understanding the Need for Combination

While each of the three address schema approaches has its merits, there might be scenarios where combining elements from all three could provide a more comprehensive solution. For instance:

Handling multiple addresses per customer: This is a common requirement.
Tracking address history: Useful for analysis, compliance, and dispute resolution.
Optimizing performance: Balancing data redundancy and query efficiency.
Proposed Combined Schema

SQL
CREATE TABLE customers (
    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    email VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE addresses (
    address_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    address_type VARCHAR(20), -- billing, shipping, etc.
    is_primary BIT, -- Indicates the default address
    effective_date DATE,
    end_date DATE, -- NULL if current address
    street VARCHAR(100),
    city VARCHAR(50),
    state VARCHAR(50),
    zip VARCHAR(20),
    country VARCHAR(50),
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id)
);
